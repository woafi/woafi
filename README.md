# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mohammad Woafi
## 🚀 About Me
A passionate Computer Science and Engineering student with a deep interest in building scalable, full-stack web applications and solving complex problems through efficient Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

💻 What I Do
I specialize in Full-Stack Web Development, focusing on modern technologies like Node.js, React, and Next.js. My current work revolves around enhancing backend capabilities while crafting responsive and intuitive front-end experiences. I’ve also explored projects involving API integration, local storage management, and deploying production-ready apps using platforms like Vercel.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m actively diving into Python and Django Core to expand my backend stack, while also strengthening my problem-solving skills through LeetCode topic-wise practice. I’m on a mission to become a well-rounded Full-Stack Developer who writes clean, secure, and efficient code.
